## Citi Bike Station Analysis
This is an analysis of Citi Bike station usage in New York City. I have analyzed this to find out the usage by gender, overall capacity, and duration. I was able to conclude that there is an issue with the amount of bikes being left unattended, specifically in the "unknown gender" category.
